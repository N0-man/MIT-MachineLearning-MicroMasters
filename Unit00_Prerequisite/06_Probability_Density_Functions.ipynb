    "\n",
    "The PDF of a Uniform distribution in the interval [a, b] is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   f(x) = 1 / (b - a) for a <= x <= b\n",
    "   f(x) = 0 otherwise\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that all outcomes in the interval [a, b] are equally likely. For example, if a = 0 and b = 1, then the probability of x being between 0 and 1 is 1, and outside this interval is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's true that the total probability (the area under the curve of the probability density function) must be 1, the value of the density function itself can be greater than 1. The height of the probability density function is 2 for all x in [0, 0.5], even though the probabilities themselves must be between 0 and 1. This is because the density function represents probability per unit of x, and the total probability is obtained by integrating the density function over the range of x, which gives an area (probability) of 1.\n"

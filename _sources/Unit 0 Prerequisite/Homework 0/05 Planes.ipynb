    "A hyperplane in n-dimensional space is a subspace that is one dimension less than the space itself. It's an \"n-1\" dimensional subspace of an \"n\" dimensional space.\n",

    "Here are some examples to illustrate this concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In 2-dimensional space (a plane)**: A hyperplane is a 1-dimensional line. For example, in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, the line defined by the equation `y = 2x + 1` is a hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In 3-dimensional space**: A hyperplane is a 2-dimensional plane. For example, in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, the plane defined by the equation `2x + 3y - z = 5` is a hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In 4-dimensional space**: A hyperplane is a 3-dimensional space. It's harder to visualize, but it's defined by an equation like `x + 2y + 3z - 4w = 7`.\n",

The coefficients $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ determine the orientation of the hyperplane in the space, and the constant $b$ determines its offset from the origin."

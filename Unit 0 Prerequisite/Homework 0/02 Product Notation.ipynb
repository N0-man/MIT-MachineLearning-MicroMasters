    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "Let's break it down step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The symbol $\\prod$ denotes the product of a series of terms.\n",
    "- The subscript $i=1$ indicates that the product starts from $i=1$.\n",
    "- The superscript $M$ indicates that the product goes up to $M$.\n",

    "In closed form, this can be written as $(\\frac{1}{\\theta})^M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because when you multiply a number by itself multiple times, it is equivalent to raising that number to the power of the number of times you multiply it.\n",

    "The expression $\\ln \\left(\\prod _{k=1}^ K e^ k\\right)$ involves both the natural logarithm function (denoted by $\\ln$) and the product notation (denoted by $\\prod$). Here's what it means:\n",

    "- The symbol $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm, which is the logarithm to the base $e$.\n",

    "- The term inside the product, $e^k$, represents the value of each term in the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This product notation represents the product of a sequence where each term is $e$ raised to the power of $k$. \n",

    "e^1 \\times e^2 \\times e^3 \\times \\ldots \\times e^K\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{1+2+3+...+K}\n",

    "\n",
    "Because of the properties of logarithms, specifically the property that $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$, the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms. So, we can rewrite the original expression as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the sum of the first $K$ positive integers, which has a closed form given by the formula $\\frac{K(K+1)}{2}$.\n",
    "e.g. if K=5, then 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and $\\frac{5(5+1)}{2} = 15$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the closed form of $\\ln \\left(\\prod _{k=1}^ K e^ k\\right)$ is $\\frac{K(K+1)}{2}$."

    "## Differential Calculus\n",

    "For a general function $f(x)$, the derivative $f'(x)$ can be found by applying the rules of differentiation. Here are some basic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant Rule**: The derivative of a constant is 0.\n",
    "2. **Power Rule**: The derivative of $x^n$ is $n*x^{n-1}$.\n",
    "3. **Product Rule**: The derivative of $u*v$ is $u'*v + u*v'$.\n",
    "4. **Quotient Rule**: The derivative of $u/v` is `(u'*v - u*v') / v^2$.\n",
    "5. **Chain Rule**: The derivative of $f(g(x)) ` is ` f'(g(x)) * g'(x)$.\n",

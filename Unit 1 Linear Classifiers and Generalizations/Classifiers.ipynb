    "Training data can be graphically depicted on a (hyper)plane. Classifiers are mappings that take feature vectors as input and produce labels as output. A common kind of classifier is the linear classifier, which linearly divides space(the (hyper)plane where training data lies) into two. Given a point $x$ in the space, the classifier $h$ outputs $h(x) = 1$ or $h(x) = -1$, depending on where the point $x$ exists in among the two linearly divided spaces."
